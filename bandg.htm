            <p>Rebecca Theresa Hren was born at Euclid General Hospital on April 
              12, 1979 in Euclid, Ohio. Becky attended the Euclid City Schools 
              from kindergarten until she graduated in 1997. While there she was 
              involved in multitudes of activities including cheerleading and 
              swim team. After graduation Becky attended Ohio Northern University 
              in Ada, Ohio. She graduated in 2003 with a PharmD (Doctor of Pharmacy) 
              degree. Becky accepted a clinical pharmacist position with Lake 
              Hospital System and has been there since the beginning of June. 
              Her office is located at Lake East in Painesville and that is where 
              she does a majority of her work with the physicians, nurses and 
              other pharmacists. In her spare time she loves to shop, shop, shop, 
              clean like a crazy lady, ski, watch replay TV, and go out to eat 
              with her Mike!</p></td>

            <p>Michael Ohlsen (better known as Mick to his family, Mojo or Mohlsen 
              to his buds and as Jimmy to the Hren family [do not ask]) has an 
              obvious identity crisis going on. Mike was born on June 29, 1977 
              in Meadville, Pennsylvania. He lived in Meadville for 10 years before 
              his family packed up and headed to Wooster, Ohio. There Mike finished 
              his schooling and graduated in 1996 from Wooster High School. From 
              there Mike was off to Ohio Northern University to attain his Electrical/Computer 
              Science Engineering degree. Mike currently works for an engineering 
              firm called Fenetech in Aurora, Ohio. It is there that he utilizes 
              all his nerdy computer skills to crank out new software. In Mike&#8217;s 
              spare time he enjoys watching and playing hockey, playing on the 
              numerous computers he has at home along with networking the house, 
              getting the most unbelievable deals online, and going out with Becky.</p>

            year that they met. It was early March of 1998, the first weekend 
            of Spring quarter that they met at a sorority/fraternity party. Beck 
            is a Delta Zeta and Mike is a member of Delta Sigma Phi. Mike and 
            Becky agree that they met in the above way, but do not ask the two 
            when their first kiss was because you will get two completely different 
            answers!</td>
