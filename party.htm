              Seth on the very first night of college at Ohio Northern University 
              when Seth came stumbling into his room after a night on the town. 
              Let's just say things have not changed much over the years! As the 
              years went on at Ohio Northern Mike and Seth became close friends 
              as they were in the fraternity (Delta Sigma Phi) together and they 
              had the exact same major / minor. They were nearly in every class 
              together, were lab partners in nearly every lab, and shared an office 
              their final year. Without each other, many people think that neither 
              Mike or Seth would have graduated from school. Seth currently works 
              for American Electric Power in Columbus. However, he will be leaving 
              AEP this fall to attend the University of Dayton Law School. Mike 
              is going to be waiting for Seth to give him a late night call when 
              he needs a study break. At the end of June, Seth was married to 
              a great Philly girl, Heather! </p></td>

              than anyone can imagine, here is an abbreviated list: candle making, 
              poetry, playing in his band, kayaking, mountain biking, cross country 
              skiing, snow boarding, wood working, and his latest obsession photography. 
              His life long dream is to retire early and support himself off one 
              of his hobbies. His photography skills may be leading him in the

              pharmacy. After that they were roommates for the next three years 
              of pharmacy school and had a blast in every place they lived. Sarah 
              graduated from pharmacy school this past year with Becky, making

              college, Mike and Kent kept in contact, sharing their new found 
              engineering knowledge quite frequently. Kent graduated from Case 
              Western Reserve University in 2001 with a Bachelors degree in Biomedical 
              Engineering and a Master's degree in Electrical engineering. He

              rushed and pledged the same sorority, Delta Zeta. Their friendship 
              really began to flourish during their sophomore year when they lived 
              across the hall from each other on &quot;the floor.&quot; The floor 
              was just a floor in the dorms on which all the sophomore Delta Zetas 
              lived. After that they lived together in the DZ house and finally 
              during Brooke's senior year (Becky's P4 or fourth year) in the house 
              at 330 W. Buckeye. That year at 330 was AWESOME and is truly where 
              some of the best college memories were made daily! Brooke graduated 
              in 2001 from the Ohio Northern College of Business and less than 
              one year later got her nursing home administrator license. Brooke 
              currently works as the head administrator for a nursing home in
