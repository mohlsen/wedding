                <td height="418" colspan="2" valign="top"><p>In the 1920s, Euclid 
                    Village was a quiet farming community that was poised to become 
                    one of Cleveland's fastest growing suburbs. To meet the spiritual 
                    needs of the growing Catholic population in the area, Bishop 
                    Joseph Schrembs established Holy Cross Parish on September 
                    19, 1924. On Sunday September 21, Dr. Kirby celebrated the 
                    first Masses in the newly formed parish in a house at the 
                    corner of Lake Shore Blvd and East 201st Street that is now 
                    the Knights of Columbus Hall. </p>
                  <p>After making it through the many hardships that the depression 
                    brought, it was in late 1948, when parish council approved 
                    the purchase of four lots adjoining the parish property and 
                    hired an architect to draw up plans for the building we today 
                    know as Holy Cross. The altar was consecrated in December 
                    of 1955. The focal point of the newly completed church was 
                    the 14-foot cross with its life-size hand-carved corpus above 
                    the main altar. All of the stained glass windows in the church 
                    were designed by the world-renowned stained glass artist, 
                    Rudolf R. Sandon. </p>
                  <p>The church remained basically the same for the next forty 
                    years. However it was becoming clear to all that the building 
                    was in need of much more than simple repairs, so in 1994 the 
                    parish embarked on the most ambitious project of the nineties- 
                    a complete renovation of the worship space and construction 
                    of a new gym. </p>
                  <p>The inside of the church was completely remodeled and updated. 
                    In addition to upgrades of the heating and electrical systems, 
                    the floor was replaced, the walls repaired, and the ceiling 
                    cleaned and lightened. The choir loft was rebuilt to accommodate 
                    a baptismal font just inside the main entrance, and a Blessed 
                    Sacrament chapel was constructed. The pews were replaced with 
                    chairs which can be moved to accommodate different kinds of 
                    liturgical celebrations. The new altar was placed closer to 
                    the center of the church, with seating on three sides to give 
                    the sense that we truly are gathered around the table of the 
                    Lord. The work was finished just in time for Christmas Masses 
                    to be celebrated in the new worship space. Mass that year 
                    was truly magical!<br>
