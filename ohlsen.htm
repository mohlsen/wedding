            <p>The Ohlsen&#8217;s family lives in Wooster, about an hour south 
              of Cleveland. They have resided there for about 15 years after moving 
              from Meadeville PA. It&#8217;s a cute little town that has given 
              Mike and now Becky an appreciation for the country.<br>

          <td width="58%"><strong>Diane Ohlsen</strong> <p>Mike&#8217;s mother, 
              Diane, is a First Grade teacher for Wooster City Schools. Like Becky&#8217;s 
              mom, she has been a teacher her whole life, but stayed home with 
              the children until they were in school full time. She has now been 
              teaching those little ones down in Wayne County for about 15 years. 
              Many people would say that a first grade teacher does not have much 
              impact on such young children, but after watching Diane interact 
              with her current and past students, it is obvious that her early 
              childhood teaching skills have influenced many lives. She is so 
              involved in her work, that Diane actually goes to bed anxiously 
              waiting for the next day to begin! Almost all of her spare time 
              activities involve working on her classroom and preparing for the 
              next lesson. When she does get away from the classroom, Diane enjoys 
              reading, going on walks, and sleeping in the hammock.</p>
            <hr> <p><strong>Mike Ohlsen</strong></p>
            <p>Big Mike, as they like to call him, is a native of western Pennsylvania 
              and southern New Jersey. Once you hear him ask for a glass or &#8220;watta&#8221; 
              (water) or suggest you use a &#8220;coopon&#8221; (coupon) at a 
              grocery store, you will certainly hear the accent. He is now an 
              industrial engineer at the Will-Burt Company located in Orrville, 
              OH. Mike is a hands-on guy who loves to tinker around with tools 
              and cars. He is an all around handy man, who would be glad to help 
              any stranger off the block with their household chores. In his spare 
              time, Mike likes to watch Philadelphia and Cleveland based sporting 
              events, and complains that his team never wins. After the games 
              are over you will usually find Mike asleep on the couch with an 
              old Star Trek re-run on the television.<br>

                      younger sister by almost five years. Growing up, the age 
                      difference kept the two at odds most of the time, bickering 
                      and teasing one another. Maybe Mike used to pick on her 
                      because she tried to cut his ear off with a pair of plastic 
                      scissors at the age of three (ask any Ohlsen for the full 
                      story!) But as they have grown older, Mike and Suzi have 
                      grown much closer to one another due, in part, to Becky. 
                      Suzi is currently a junior at Wittenberg University majoring 
                      in Early Childhood Education. She hopes to someday marry 
                      a rich man so she does not have to work and support her 
                      spending habits.<br>
