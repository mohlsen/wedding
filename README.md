Our Wedding Website (circa 2003)

I was cleaning out some old drives, and ran across on of the first websites I ever created.  Obviously it was for our wedding.  Back in 2003, not many people had wedding websites, and if they did, being able to RSVP on it was very rare.  We had many attendees who could not figure it out, and rsorted to calling our parents.  

Wow, have my development skills changed!  Flashback!
